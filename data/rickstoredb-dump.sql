Because neutrinos can pass through matter almost unimpeded, a sufficient intensity of neutrinos will travel through the earth and deliver a lethal dose to the entire population in a fraction of a second.','Neutrino Bomb',5000000,'neutrino_bomb.jpg'),(3,'Weapon','2024-09-04 19:27:37.000000','The Portal Gun is Rick\'s most-used invention. It is a gun that shoots green, fluidic portals onto any surface and allows the user(s) to travel between different universes, dimensions and realities.

In the Rick and Morty Simpsons couch gag, it is used on the Simpsons\' neighbor, Ned Flanders.','Freeze Ray',2000000,'freeze_ray.jpg'),(5,'Device','2024-09-04 19:27:37.000000','The Cognition Amplifier is a helmet that can increase the intelligence of anything that wears it.

Its counterpart, a growth/enlarge ray, is located inside of Ruben in the colon.','Shrink Ray',3000000,'shrink_ray.jpg'),(8,'Device','2024-09-04 19:27:37.000000','Dark matter is a form of matter that has been unsolved by scientists. Rick knows the formula on how to create concentrated dark matter as a fuel source to enable faster space travel, and the formula is a secret that the Zigerions have long sought to steal from him. However, in the episode \'M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,\' he fooled the Zigerions into believing that the formula included water and cesium. When they attempted to follow his fake recipe, Rick had escaped and the Zigerions had blown themselves up.','Dark Matter',4000000,'dark_matter.jpg'),(9,'Device','2024-09-04 19:27:37.000000','The Meeseeks Box is a box that is able to create a Meeseeks which will stop at nothing to complete simple tasks. Meeseeks Boxes don\'t seem to have been created by Rick as Mr. Meeseeks has been seen through the galaxy.','Meeseeks Box',1000000,'meeseeks_box.jpg'),(10,'Device','2024-09-04 19:27:37.000000','The ionic defibulizer was an invention with an unknown purpose seen in the episode Rick Potion 9.

The potion is extracted from a vole and the DNA from a strand of Morty\'s hair. The love potion would work on anyone it infects except for people who are genetically related to him. If this is used on someone with the flu, it will piggyback on the influenza and become a contagious pathogen, spreading and causing everyone in the world except the Smith family to fall completely in love with Morty.','Love Potion',3000000,'love_potion.jpg'),(13,'Potion','2024-09-04 19:27:37.000000','Rick used a gaseous antidote on the city\'s population to turn them back to normal again, but he messed up somewhere and turned them all into mantis-men that were still in love with Morty and now wanted to eat his head. His first attempt at an antidote resulted in this because of Rick reasoning that since praying mantis females eat their mate\'s head while mating, praying mantis DNA should be the main ingredient in an anti-love potion. The second attempt included many more genetic samples from a menagerie of organisms, wrongly assuming that using it on the infatuated mantis-men would restore their humanity.','Love Antidote',2500000,'love_antidote.jpg'),(14,'Device','2024-09-04 19:27:37.000000','In the episode \'Rixty Minutes\', Rick installed this after complaining about the quality of TV and Jerry challenges him to provide anything better, installing a cable box that shows television from every conceivable reality.','Inter Dimensional Cable',4000000,'inter_dimensional_cable.jpg'),(15,'Device','2024-09-04 19:27:37.000000','The goggles work by synching the user\'s eyes to the genetic code found across countless realities.
